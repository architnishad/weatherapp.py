# weatherapp.py
This Weather App is built using Python’s Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.  It allows users to check the current weather conditions, temperature, pressure, and description of any selected location (city or state).
